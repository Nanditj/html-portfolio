<h1>The Best Movies According to Thandi</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Back To the Future</h3>
<p>This is my favourite movie. It involves a science experiment which allows the wrong person to travel to the past instead of the future. 
    Its a great movie for the entire family.</p>
<h3>The Truman Show</h3>
<p> A movie about a man in search of happiness. He has a sense that the direction of his life is wrong in some way and seeks to find answers.</p>
<h3>The Shinning</h3>
<p>This movie made me feel chills, it was humorous, scary, exciting, and ahead of its time in every way. A true classic.</p>
